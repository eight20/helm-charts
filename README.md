# Helm Charts Repo


## How Do I Enable the Moveax Helm Repository?

To add the Moveax charts for your local client, run `helm repo add`:

```
$ helm repo add moveax https://moveaxlab.github.io/helm-charts
"moveax" has been added to your repositories
```

Update Helm repo's :

```
$ helm repo update
```

You can then run `helm search moveax` to see the charts.
